Key findings include: leg extensions can cause anterior shear force and patellofemoral compression, especially with improper form, excessive weight, or near full extension. This can aggravate conditions like Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) and potentially stress ligaments like the ACL.",

PFPS is a strong candidate due to its association with anterior knee pain aggravated by exercises that increase patellofemoral stress. Quadriceps tendinopathy is also possible. Less likely but considered are meniscus tears or early osteoarthritis, especially if other symptoms are present or if pain is diffuse.",

This includes what to avoid (locking knees, heavy weight, jerky movements), what to do (controlled motion, partial range, moderate weight), and alternative exercises (seated extensions, bodyweight variations, closed-chain exercises like squats/leg press).",

This symptom profile, combined with the context of running and the location (Achilles), strongly suggests an overuse injury. The search results confirm that Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury in runners, characterized by pain that worsens with activity and the day after. Gait analysis is highlighted as crucial, as running mechanics can contribute to the condition. The tendon's role in storing and releasing energy during running means that repetitive stress, especially with changes in training load or intensity, can lead to micro-tears and inflammation (tendinopathy). The fact that pain is worse the next day, rather than acutely severe during the run, points away from a rupture and towards a degenerative process like tendinopathy. Therefore, the reasoning chain leads to Achilles tendinopathy as the primary diagnosis, necessitating load management, specific exercises, and potentially gait retraining.",

Specific exercises to avoid include deep squats (beyond 60\u00b0 knee flexion) and high-intensity energy storage activities, as these can exacerbate pain and patellofemoral load. Substitutions focus on less provocative movements like partial squats, isometric exercises, and limited-range decline squats. Load adjustment involves reducing overall intensity and volume, focusing on controlled eccentric phases, and progressing gradually based on pain levels (typically <3/10). Progression criteria are primarily pain-guided, with a move from higher repetition/lower load (15RM) to lower repetition/higher load (6RM) in isotonic phases.

The search results confirm that DOMS is a common post-exercise phenomenon after strenuous loading, particularly eccentric loading like that experienced during RDLs (Wilke, 2021). The timing (48 hours post-exercise) and mild, bilateral nature of the soreness strongly support DOMS. Hamstring soreness after RDLs is also noted as a normal occurrence (Reddit user). Therefore, the primary assessment is DOMS. Red flags are absent as the symptoms are typical for DOMS. The recovery timeline is estimated based on typical DOMS resolution, usually within a week. Exercise modifications focus on reducing load and intensity for subsequent sessions to allow for recovery, as suggested by general principles of managing muscle soreness and by information on modifying exercises when pain is present (e3rehab.com). The differential diagnosis considers other possibilities like hamstring strain, but these are deemed less likely due to the delayed onset and mild, bilateral presentation.",
