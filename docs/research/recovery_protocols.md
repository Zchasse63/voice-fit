## Recovery Timeline Framework

### Muscle Strain Recovery Durations

Based on sports medicine literature, muscle strain recovery follows these evidence-based timelines:

| Severity | Type | Duration | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Mild** | Type I (Overexertion) | 5-8 days | Functional muscle disorder without macroscopic fiber tear |
| **Moderate** | Type III (Partial Tear) | 16-38 days (2-5 weeks) | Partial structural damage with fiber disruption |
| **Severe** | Complete Muscle Injury | 62 days (9 weeks) | (Sub)total tear or tendinous avulsion |

**Source:** Sports medicine research on muscle injury classification

### Tendinopathy Recovery Durations

| Injury Type | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
|-------------|------|----------|--------|
| **Achilles Tendinitis** | 2-4 weeks | 6-12 weeks | 3-6 months |
| **Patellar Tendinitis** | 2-4 weeks | 6-12 weeks | 3-6 months |
| **Rotator Cuff Tendinitis** | 2-4 weeks | 6-12 weeks | 3-6 months (or surgery) |

### Joint Sprain Recovery Durations

| Injury Type | Grade I (Mild) | Grade II (Moderate) | Grade III (Severe) |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Ankle Sprain** | 1-3 weeks | 3-6 weeks | 6-12 weeks |
| **Wrist Sprain** | 1-2 weeks | 3-6 weeks | 6-12 weeks |
| **Knee Ligament** | 2-4 weeks | 6-12 weeks | 3-6 months (or surgery) |

### Lower Back Pain Recovery

| Type | Duration | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Acute Muscle Strain** | 1-3 weeks | Most resolve within 2 weeks |
| **Subacute** | 3-12 weeks | May require physical therapy |
| **Chronic** | >12 weeks | Requires comprehensive management |

## Recovery Phases

### Phase 1: Acute (0-5 days)

**Characteristics:**
- Immediate post-injury period
- Peak inflammation and pain
- Focus on protection and pain management

**Management:**
- RICE protocol (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation)
- Avoid aggravating activities
- Pain management (ice, NSAIDs if appropriate)
- Gentle range of motion within pain-free limits

**Check-in Frequency:** Daily self-assessment

**Expected Progress:**
- Pain reduction from initial levels
- Swelling stabilization or reduction
- Improved ability to perform basic movements

---

### Phase 2: Early-Stage Recovery (5-21 days)

**Characteristics:**
- Inflammation subsiding
- Tissue healing begins
- Gradual return to light activity

**Management:**
- Progressive loading within pain tolerance
- Mobility and flexibility work
- Light strengthening exercises
- Modified training (reduced volume/intensity)

**Check-in Frequency:** Every 3-5 days (twice weekly)

**Expected Progress:**
- 10-20% improvement per week in early phase
- Gradual increase in pain-free range of motion
- Ability to perform daily activities without significant limitation

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Recovery (21 days to 6-12 months)

**Characteristics:**
- Tissue remodeling and strengthening
- Progressive return to full activity
- Focus on preventing re-injury

**Management:**
- Sport-specific training progression
- Strength and conditioning
- Technique refinement
- Gradual return to pre-injury training loads

**Check-in Frequency:** Weekly

**Expected Progress:**
- Continued strength gains
- Return to sport-specific movements
- Minimal to no pain with activity

---

## Weekly Check-in Assessment Framework

### Assessment Questions

**1. Pain Level (0-10 scale)**
- Current pain at rest
- Pain with specific movements
- Pain during daily activities
- Pain during exercise

**2. Range of Motion Quality**
- Compared to uninjured side
- Pain-free ROM percentage
- Stiffness or catching sensations

**3. Activity Tolerance**
- What activities can you perform without pain?
- What activities cause pain or discomfort?
- Have you been able to increase activity level?

**4. New Symptoms**
- Any new pain locations?
- Swelling, bruising, or discoloration?
- Numbness, tingling, or weakness?

**5. Functional Capacity**
- Can you perform daily activities normally?
- Can you perform modified training?
- Can you perform sport-specific movements?

---

## Normal Progression Indicators

### Week-to-Week Improvement Benchmarks

**Early Phase (Weeks 1-3):**
- 10-20% reduction in pain per week
- Gradual increase in pain-free ROM
- Improved ability to perform daily activities

**Mid Phase (Weeks 3-6):**
- 5-15% improvement per week
- Return to light training with modifications
- Minimal pain with daily activities

**Late Phase (Weeks 6+):**
- Continued strength gains
- Progressive return to full training
- Minimal to no pain with most activities

### Signs of Proper Healing

✅ **Positive Indicators:**
- Gradual, consistent pain reduction
- Improving range of motion
- Progressive strength gains
- Ability to increase activity without setbacks
- Swelling reduction
- Improved functional capacity

---

## Warning Signs & Escalation Criteria

### Plateau Identification

**Concern if:**
- No improvement for 2-3 consecutive check-ins
- Pain level unchanged for 2+ weeks
- ROM not improving over 2+ weeks
- Unable to progress activity level

**Action:** Consider physical therapy consultation

### Worsening Symptoms

**Immediate Concern if:**
- Pain increasing instead of decreasing
- New swelling or bruising
- Increasing functional limitation
- New symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness)

**Action:** Consult healthcare provider within 48 hours

### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Medical Attention

🚨 **Seek immediate care if:**
- Severe pain (8-10/10) that doesn't improve with rest
- Inability to bear weight or use affected limb
- Visible deformity
- Severe swelling within hours of injury
- Numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation
- Loss of pulse or circulation
- Fever or signs of infection
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing

---

## Return-to-Activity Criteria

### Functional Testing Benchmarks

Before returning to full training, athlete should demonstrate:

**1. Pain Criteria:**
- Pain ≤1/10 at rest
- Pain ≤2/10 with sport-specific movements
- No sharp or acute pain with any movement

**2. Range of Motion:**
- ≥90% of uninjured side
- Full pain-free ROM in all planes
- No catching, clicking, or instability

**3. Strength:**
- ≥85% Limb Symmetry Index (LSI)
- Ability to perform sport-specific movements with proper form
- No compensatory patterns

**4. Functional Capacity:**
- Can perform all daily activities without limitation
- Can perform sport-specific drills at 75% intensity
- Can complete modified training session without pain increase

**5. Psychological Readiness:**
- Confidence in injured area
- No fear of re-injury
- Willing to progress training

## Check-in Frequency Guidelines

### By Injury Severity

| Severity | Phase 1 (0-5 days) | Phase 2 (5-21 days) | Phase 3 (21+ days) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Mild** | Daily self-check | Every 5-7 days | Every 7-14 days |
| **Moderate** | Daily self-check | Every 3-5 days | Every 7 days |
| **Severe** | Daily + medical | Every 2-3 days | Every 5-7 days |

### Trigger for Check-in Prompt

**VoiceFit Implementation:**
- Trigger check-in prompt if `last_check_in_at` ≥ 7 days ago
- Display on Home screen mount
- Show in ActiveInjuryBanner component
- Allow user to dismiss if feeling better

---

## Recovery Progress Calculation

### Progress Score Formula

```
progress_score = (
  (pain_reduction * 0.4) +
  (rom_improvement * 0.3) +
  (functional_capacity * 0.2) +
  (activity_tolerance * 0.1)
)
```

**Where:**
- `pain_reduction` = (initial_pain - current_pain) / initial_pain
- `rom_improvement` = current_rom / target_rom
- `functional_capacity` = activities_possible / total_activities
- `activity_tolerance` = current_intensity / target_intensity

**Interpretation:**
- 0.0-0.3: Minimal progress (consider escalation)
- 0.3-0.6: Moderate progress (continue current plan)
- 0.6-0.8: Good progress (consider progression)
- 0.8-1.0: Excellent progress (near return-to-activity)

## Implementation Notes for VoiceFit

### Weekly Check-in Logic

```typescript
// Trigger check-in if:
// 1. Injury status is "active" (not resolved)
// 2. Last check-in was ≥7 days ago
// 3. User opens app (Home screen mount)

const shouldTriggerCheckIn = (injury: InjuryLog): boolean => {
  if (injury.status !== 'active') return false;
  
  const daysSinceCheckIn = getDaysSince(injury.lastCheckInAt);
  return daysSinceCheckIn >= 7;
};
```

### Recovery Status Updates

```typescript
type RecoveryStatus = 
  | 'improving'      // Normal progress
  | 'plateau'        // No change for 2+ weeks
  | 'worsening'      // Symptoms getting worse
  | 'resolved';      // Fully recovered

// Update based on check-in responses
```
