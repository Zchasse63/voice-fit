# VoiceFit 2.0 Build Instructions

**For:** Claude Code / AI Assistant
**Project:** VoiceFit - Voice-first fitness tracking app
**Start Date:** [Insert date]

---

## Project Overview

You are building VoiceFit 2.0, a complete rebuild of a voice-first fitness tracking application. This is a **greenfield build** - start fresh with no legacy code. All features, UI specifications, and AI prompts are documented in this repository.

### Core Value Proposition
VoiceFit lets users log workouts hands-free using voice commands. Say "bench press 225 for 8" and it's logged. The app includes AI coaching, personalized program generation, running tracking, wearable integration, and a coach platform.

### Target Platforms
- **Mobile:** iOS and Android (React Native/Expo)
- **Web:** Single unified web app (Next.js)
- **Backend:** TypeScript/Node.js with tRPC

## Build Phases

Follow these phases in order. Do not skip ahead.

### Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Working app shell with auth and database

**Tasks:**
1. Initialize Expo project with Expo Router
2. Set up tRPC backend with Drizzle ORM
3. Create Supabase project, configure auth
4. Implement secure authentication flow:
   - Email/password signup and login
   - Apple Sign-In and Google Sign-In
   - JWT token storage in SecureStore (CRITICAL: not AsyncStorage)
   - Auth state persistence
5. Build database schema (see COMPLETE_REBUILD_PLAN.md Section 5)
6. Create base UI components from UI_SPECIFICATION.md:
   - Button, Card, Input, PillBadge
   - LoadingSpinner, Toast, ErrorMessage
   - ThemeProvider with light/dark mode
7. Set up tab navigation with GlassTabBar
8. Implement basic profile screen

**Deliverable:** User can sign up, log in, see empty dashboard, toggle theme

**Critical Requirements:**
- Auth tokens MUST use SecureStore, not AsyncStorage
- All API calls through tRPC, no raw fetch
- Theme follows UI_SPECIFICATION.md exactly

## Code Standards

### File Structure
```
/apps
  /mobile          # Expo app
    /app           # Expo Router pages
    /src
      /components  # Reusable components
      /hooks       # Custom hooks
      /services    # API services
      /stores      # Zustand stores
      /theme       # Design tokens
      /types       # TypeScript types
      /utils       # Utilities
  /web             # Next.js app
  /backend         # tRPC backend
    /src
      /routers     # tRPC routers
      /services    # Business logic
      /db          # Drizzle schemas
      /ai          # AI service integrations
/packages
  /shared          # Shared types/utils
```

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (`WorkoutCard.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useWorkout.ts`)
- Services: camelCase (`workoutService.ts`)
- Types: PascalCase (`Workout`, `Exercise`)
- Database tables: snake_case (`workout_sets`)
- API routes: camelCase (`workout.create`)

### Component Guidelines
1. All components must support light/dark theme via `useTheme()`
2. Use design tokens from `tokens.ts`, never hardcode colors
3. Use Reanimated for animations, follow spring configs in UI_SPECIFICATION.md
4. Include haptic feedback on interactive elements (see haptics section)
5. Support loading and error states
6. Add accessibility labels

### Type Safety
- Enable strict TypeScript everywhere
- No `any` types without explicit justification
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- tRPC provides end-to-end type safety - leverage it

---

## Testing Requirements

For each phase:
1. Unit tests for services and utilities
2. Component tests for UI components
3. Integration tests for API routes
4. E2E tests for critical flows (auth, workout logging, voice)

---

## What You Cannot Do (Developer Handoff)

These tasks require human developers with access to actual devices and services:

1. **Running the app** - You can write code but cannot execute React Native
2. **Native modules** - Apple Watch, HealthKit, Google Fit require native development
3. **API key configuration** - Store secrets securely in environment
4. **Visual QA** - Screenshots needed to verify UI matches spec
5. **Real API testing** - Actual Supabase, xAI, Moonshot API calls
6. **App Store deployment** - Requires Apple/Google developer accounts
7. **OAuth setup** - Apple/Google Sign-In requires console configuration

---

## Getting Started

When beginning work, follow this sequence:

1. **Read** `COMPLETE_REBUILD_PLAN.md` completely
2. **Read** `UI_SPECIFICATION.md` design system
3. **Create** initial project structure with Expo and tRPC
4. **Implement** Phase 0 foundation
5. **Commit** frequently with descriptive messages
6. **Document** any deviations or decisions made

### First Session Prompt
```
Read all documents in the docs/ folder. Then start Phase 0: Foundation.
Create the Expo project with Expo Router, set up tRPC backend with
Drizzle ORM, and implement secure authentication. Follow the tech
stack exactly as specified in the build instructions.
```

## Questions to Ask Before Building

If any of these are unclear, ask before proceeding:

1. Supabase project URL and keys?
2. AI API keys (xAI, Moonshot, OpenAI)?
3. Any features to prioritize or skip?
4. Target MVP date?
5. Team structure for handoff?

---

## Success Criteria

The rebuild is successful when:

- [ ] All Phase 0-2 features work (auth, voice logging, AI coach)
- [ ] UI matches UI_SPECIFICATION.md exactly
- [ ] All AI prompts produce expected outputs
- [ ] Offline mode works for workout logging
- [ ] Performance: <100ms voice parsing, <2s program generation
- [ ] Code is clean, typed, and documented
- [ ] Tests pass for critical paths
